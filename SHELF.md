# Functionality

 - Assign permissions to owner when creating new organization

 - Get existing functional tests working with new setup

 - Functional tests for API?

 - SASS compilation (currently manual)

 - Need to work out which views require Login

 - Permissions everywhere: user index and update, project index,
   detail, creation, organization index detail creation

 - Check on login for deactivated users: missing template maybe?

 - Project overview: slider to collapse text; map zoom controls to
   lower-right?

 - Add translations to templates

# Clean up

 - URL config

 - Make naming of template files consistent

 - Make page titles consistent

 - Entry point for creating new projects, should it be the root level of an
   organization dashboard

# Bugs

 - Adding project step 3 throws `Role matching query does not exist`
