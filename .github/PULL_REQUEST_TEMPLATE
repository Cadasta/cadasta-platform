### Checklist (for reviewing)

#### Functionality

- [ ] **Are all requirements met?** Compare implemented functionality with the requirements specification.
- [ ] **Does the UI work as expected?** There should be no Javascript errors in the console; all resources should load. There should be no unexpected errors. Deliberately try to break the feature to find out if there are corner cases that are not handled. 

#### Code

- [ ] **Do you fully understand the introduced changes to the code?** If not ask for clarification, it might uncover ways to solve a problem in a more elegant and efficient way.
- [ ] **Does the PR introduce any inefficient database requests?** Use the debug server to check for duplicate requests. 

#### Tests

- [ ] **Are there sufficient test cases?** Ensure that all components are tested individually; models, forms, and serializers should be tested in isolation even if a test for a view covers these components. If this is a bug fix, there must be a test case for the bug to ensure the issue wonâ€™t regress. 


#### Documentation

- [ ] **Are changes to the UI documented in the platform docs?** If this PR introduces new platform site functionality or changes existing ones, the changes must be documented in the [Cadasta Platform Documentation](https://github.com/Cadasta/cadasta-docs).
- [ ] **Are changes to the API documented in the API docs?** If this PR introduces new API functionality or changes existing ones, the changes must be documented in the [API docs](https://github.com/Cadasta/api-docs).
- [ ] **Are reusable components documented?** If this PR introduces components that are relevant to other developers (for instance a mixin for a view or a generic form) they should be documented in the Wiki.
